            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nHyPhy (\nHy\npothesis Testing using \nPhy\nlogenies) is an open-source software package for the analysis of genetic sequences (in particular the inference of natural selection) using techniques in phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and machine learning. It features a rich scripting language for limitless customization of analyses. Additionally, HyPhy features support for parallel computing environments (via message passing interface). HyPhy has over 10000 registered users and has been cited in over 1800 peer-reviewed publications (\nGoogle Scholar\n). \n\n\nBrief history\n#\n\n\nHyPhy grew out of the collaboration between \nSpencer Muse\n and \nSergei Kosakovsky Pond\n that commenced in 1997 and continues to this day, with many additional collaborators, including \nArt Poon\n, \nSimon Frost\n, \nSteven Weaver\n, \nStephanie Spielman\n, \nLance Hepler\n, \nMartin Smith\n, \nKonrad Scheffler\n, \nWayne Delport\n, \nBen Murrell\n, and \nJoel Wertheim\n. HyPhy was originally released in 2000, is currently at version 2.3, and is presently undergoing a major rewrite, with version v3.0 planned for release in 2018. \n\n\nDesign philosophy\n#\n\n\nHyPhy was designed to allow the specification and fitting of a broad class of continuous-time discrete-space Markov models of sequence evolution. To implement these models, HyPhy provides its own scripting language - \nHBL\n, or \nHyPhy Batch Language\n (see \nan example\n), which can be used to develop custom analyses or modify existing ones. Importantly, it is not necessary to learn (or even be aware of) HBL in order to use HyPhy, as most common models and analyses have been implemented for user convenience. Once a model is defined, it can be fitted to data (using a fixed topology tree), its parameters can be constrained in user-defined ways to test various hypotheses (e.g. is rate1 \n rate2), and simulate data from. HyPhy primarily implements \nmaximum likelihood\n methods, but it can also be used to perform some forms of Bayesian inference (e.g. \nFUBAR\n), fit Bayesian graphical models to data, run genetic algorithms to perform complex model selection.\n\n\nFeatures\n#\n\n\n\n\nSupport for arbitrary sequence data, including nucleotide, amino-acid, codon, binary, count (microsattelite) data, including multiple partitions mixing differen data types. \n\n\nComplex models of rate variation, including site-to-site, branch-to-branch, hidden markov model (autocorrelated rates), between/within partitions, and co-varion type models.\n\n\nFast numerical fitting routines, supporting parallel and distributed execution.\n\n\nA broad collection of pre-defined evolutionary models. \n\n\nThe ability to specify flexible constraints on model parameters and estimate confidence intervals on MLEs.\n\n\nAncestral sequence reconstruction and sampling. \n\n\nSimulate data from any model that can be defined and fitted in the language.\n\n\nApply unique (for this domain) machine learning methods to discover patterns in the data, e.g. genetic algorithms, stochastic context free grammars, Bayesian graphical models.\n\n\nScript analyses completely in HBL including flow control, I/O, parallelization, etc.\n\n\n(v2.3) Modern web-applications for interactive result visualization.\n\n\n\n\nExample HBL Script\n#\n\n\n/* \n\n\n   This is an example HYPHY Batch File.\n\n\n   It reads in a MEGA format nucleotide dataset from data/hiv.nuc.\n\n\n   and fits the F81 model using the tree inclded in the file using maximum likelihood.\n\n\n   Output is printed out as a Newick Style tree with branch lengths\n\n\n   representing the number of expected substitutions per branch.\n\n\n*/\n\n\n\n// 1.

If would like to specify a particular C/C++ compiler (please note that it must support the C++-14 language standard) for your HyPhy build, use this command:  cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/C++-compiler -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/C-compiler      If you are building HyPhy under MacOS X, you can specify which version of SDK to use, for example:      cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/ .    Build HyPhy by running  make  with one of the following build targets given below. Note that including the  -j  flag for make (i.e.  make -j  target ) will dramatically speed this step up by taking advantage of multiple processors.  ## make the HYPHYMP executable:\nmake MP\n## Faster:\nmake -j MP\n\n## make the HYPHYMPI executable:\nmake MPI    MP  - build a HyPhy executable ( HYPHYMP ) using  OpenMP  to support symmetric multiprocessing. If  OpenMP  is not installed or not supported by the compiler (e.g. LLVM), the compiled executable will not support multi-threading. You can confirm  case by examining the output from running  cmake . If  openMP  is installed, you should see something similar to the following in the output:  -- Performing Test OpenMP_FLAG_DETECTED\n-- Performing Test OpenMP_FLAG_DETECTED - Success\n-- Try OpenMP CXX flag = [-fopenmp]\n-- Performing Test OpenMP_FLAG_DETECTED\n-- Performing Test OpenMP_FLAG_DETECTED - Success\n-- Found OpenMP: -fopenmp    MPI  - build a HyPhy executable ( HYPHYMPI ) using the message passing interface  MPI  to support parallel execution on distributed systems (clusters). An MPI library (e.g., OpenMPI) must be installed and available in your path. You can check if this is the case by examining the output from running  cmake . If  openMPI  is installed, you should see something similar to the following in the output:       --   Found   MPI_C :   / opt / scyld / openmpi / 1 . 6 . 3 / gnu / lib / libmpi . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libibverbs . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libdat . so ;/ usr / lib64 / librt . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnsl . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libutil . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libtorque . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnuma . so ;/ usr / lib64 / librt . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnsl . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libutil . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so \n\n     --   Found   MPI_CXX :   / opt / scyld / openmpi / 1 . 6 . 3 / gnu / lib / libmpi_cxx . so ;/ opt / scyld / openmpi / 1 . 6 . 3 / gnu / lib / libmpi . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libibverbs . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libdat . so ;/ usr / lib64 / librt . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnsl . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libutil . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libtorque . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnuma . so ;/ usr / lib64 / librt . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libnsl . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libutil . so ;/ usr / lib64 / libm . so       Finally, install HyPhy on your system with the command  make install  HyPhy will install either in its default location  /usr/local/ , or in any custom   /location/of/choice/  provided when configuring  CMake .

Instead, aBSREL will test, for each branch (or branch of interest) in the phylogeny, whether a proportion of sites have evolved under positive selection. \n\n\naBSREL differs from other branch-site model implementations by inferring the optimal number of \n\\omega\n  classes for each branch. For example, the earlier HyPhy branch-site approach (BS-REL) assumed three \n\\omega\n  rate classes for each branch and assigned each site, with some probability, to one of these classes. aBSREL, by contrast, acknowledges that different branches may feature more or less complex evolutionary patterns and hence may be better modeled by more or fewer \n\\omega\n classes. Specifically, aBSREL uses AIC\nc\n (small sample AIC) to infer the optimal number of \n\\omega\n rate classes for each branch. \n\n\nAfter aBSREL fits the full adaptive model, the Likelihood Ratio Test is performed at each branch and compares the full model to a null model where branches are not allowed to have rate classes of \n\\omega>1\n. \n\n\naBSREL can be run in two modes:\n\n\n\n\nTest a specific hypothesis by \na priori\n selecting a set of \"foreground\" branches to test for positive selection. \n\n\nPerform an exploratory analysis where all branches are tested for positive selection. In this scenario, p-values at each branch must be corrected for multiple testing (using the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Due to multiple testing, the exploratory approach \nhas much lower power\n compared to the other approach. \n\n\n\n\nIf you use aBSREL in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nSmith, MD et al. \"Less is more: an adaptive branch-site random effects model for efficient detection of episodic diversifying selection.\" Mol. Biol.

When running BUSTED, users can either specify a set of foreground branches on which to test for positive selection (remaining branches are designated \"background\"), or users can test the entire phylogeny for positive selection. In the latter case, the entire tree is effectively treated as foreground, and the test for positive selection considers the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nFor each phylogenetic partition (foreground and background branch sites), BUSTED fits a codon model with three rate classes, constrained as \n\\omega_1 \\leq \\omega_2 \\leq 1 \\leq \\omega_3\n. As in other methods, BUSTED simultaneously estimates the proportion of sites per partition belonging to each \n\\omega\n  class. This model, used as the alternative model in selection testing, is referred to as the \nUnconstrained\n model. BUSTED then tests for positive selection by comparing this model fit to a null model where \n\\omega_3 = 1\n (i.e. disallowing positive selection) on the foreground branches. This null model is also referred to as the \nConstrained\n model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then there is evidence that at least one site has, at least some of the time, experienced positive selection on the foreground branches. Importantly, a significant result \ndoes not\n mean that the gene evolved under positive selection along the entire foreground.\n\n\nBUSTED additionally calculates \"Evidence Ratios\" (ERs) for each site. The ER gives the likelihood ratio (reported on a log-scale) that the alternative model was a better fit to the data compared to the null model. The ER for each site thus provides \ndescriptive information\n about whether a given site could have evolved under positive selection. The ERs \nshould not\n be interpreted as statistical evidence for positive selection at individual sites (instead, methods like \nMEME\n, \nFEL\n, or \nFUBAR\n should be used for detecting selection at individual sites). \n\n\nFor each site, two ERs are reported: the \nConstrained Model\n ER and the \nOptimized Null\n Model ER. The Constrained Model ER calculates the evidence ratio using model parameters inferred from the Constrained model. By contrast, the Optimized Null model ER re-optimizes parameters inferred using the Constrained model for the given site of interest. These optimized parameter values are then used to calculate the site's ER. Again, while these ERs may be helpful descriptors of selection in the data set, they do not provide statistically valid evidence for positive selection at a site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\nIf you use BUSTED in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Gene-wide identification of episodic selection.\" Mol.

This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nAlthough FUBAR produces similar information to FEL, it has several key differences:\n\n\n\n\nFUBAR employs a Bayesian algorithm to infer rates, and therefore it reports evidence for positive selection using \nposterior probabilities\n (which range from 0-1), not p-values. Generally, posterior probabilities \n 0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection. \n\n\nFUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.\n\n\nFUBAR may have more power than FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak (i.e. low values of \n\\omega>1\n).\n\n\n\n\nIf you use FUBAR in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for inferring selection.\" Mol.

Because recombinant sequences cannot be adequately described with a single phylogenetic history, selection inference on recombinant data often leads to a significant increase in false positives. GARD alleviates this concern by comprehensively screening an alignment for recombination breakpoints and inferring a unique phylogenetic history for each detected recombination block.\n\n\nIf GARD detects recombination in your dataset, it will provide you with an updated \npartitioned\n dataset, where each partition corresponds to a recombination block with its own corresponding phylogeny. This partitioned dataset can then be used as input (instead of your original data) for the selection inference method of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use GARD in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nKosakovsky Pond, SL et al. \"Automated Phylogenetic Detection of Recombination Using a Genetic Algorithm.\" Mol.

Importantly, to infer \n\\omega\n rates, MEME infers a single \n\\alpha\n (dS) value and two separate \n\\beta\n (dN) values, \n\\beta^-\n and \n\\beta^+\n, which share the same \n\\alpha\n, per site. For both the null and alternative model, MEME enforces the constraint \n\\beta^- \\leq \\alpha\n. The \n\\beta^+\n parameter is therefore the key difference between null and alternative models: In the null model, \n\\beta^+\n is constrained as in the null model: \n\\beta^+ \\leq \\alpha\n, but \n\\beta^+\n is not constrained in the alternative model. Ultimately, positive selection for each site is inferred when \n\\beta^+ > \\alpha\n and shown to be significant using the likelihood ratio test. \n\n\nIf you use MEME in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Detecting individual sites subject to episodic diversifying selection.\" PLoS Genetics 8, e1002764 (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\nRELAX\n#\n\n\nRELAX is a hypothesis testing framework that asks whether the strength of natural selection has been relaxed or intensified along a specified set of test branches. RELAX is therefore \nnot\n a suitable method for explicitly testing for positive selection. Instead, RELAX is most useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection on a given gene.\n\n\nRELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each). RELAX begins by fitting a codon model with three \n\\omega\n  classes to the entire phylogeny (null model). RELAX then tests for relaxed/intensified selection by introducing the parameter \nk\n (where \nk \\geq 0\n), serving as the \nselection intensity parameter\n, as an exponent for the inferred \n\\omega\n  values: \n\\omega^k\n. Specifically, RELAX fixes the inferred \n\\omega\n values (all \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}\n) and infers, for the test branches, a value for \nk\n which modifies the rates to \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}^k\n (alternative model). RELAX then conducts a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the alternative and null models. \n\n\nA significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified\n along the test branches, and a significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed\n along the test branches.\n\n\nIn addition to this pair of null/alternative models, RELAX fits three other models meant as complementary descriptors for the data, but are not suitable for hypothesis testing. These additional models include the following:\n\n\n\n\nPartitioned MG94xREV\n - This model fits a single \n\\omega\n value, i.e. shared for all sites, to each branch partition (reference and test). Here, a total of two \n\\omega\n rates are inferred.\n\n\nPartitioned Descriptive\n - This model, like a more standard branch-site model, fits three \n\\omega\n  classes separately to each branch partition (reference and test, producing a total of six estimated \n\\omega\n rates estimated). The selection intensity parameter \nk\n is not included.\n\n\nGeneral Descriptive\n - This model fits three \n\\omega\n  classes to the full data set, ignoring the specified test and reference partition division (three total \n\\omega\n rates estimated). It subsequently fits a \nk\n parameter at each branch, ultimately tailoring the three \n\\omega\n  class values to this branch. This model may serve as a useful description of how selection intensity fluctuates over the whole tree.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use RELAX in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nWertheim, JO et al. \"RELAX: detecting relaxed selection in a phylogenetic framework.\" Mol.

Like FEL, this method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny. \n\n\nSLAC begins by optimizing branch lengths and nucleotide substitution parameters under the MG94xREV model. However, rather than using ML to fit site-specific dN and dS parameters, SLAC instead uses ML to infer the most likely ancestral sequence at each node of the phylogeny. SLAC then employs a modified version of the \nSuzuki-Gojobori counting method\n to directly count the total number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes which have occurred at each site. Significance is ascertained at each site using an extended binomial distribution. Importantly, due to its counting-based approach, SLAC may not be accurate for data sets with high divergence levels.\n\n\nIf you use SLAC in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nKosakovsky Pond, SL and Frost, SDW. \"Not So Different After All: A Comparison of Methods for Detecting Amino Acid Sites Under Selection.\" Mol.

Generally, posterior probabilities   0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection.   FUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.  FUBAR may have more power than FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak (i.e. low values of  \\omega>1 ).

Because recombinant sequences cannot be adequately described with a single phylogenetic history, selection inference on recombinant data often leads to a significant increase in false positives. GARD alleviates this concern by comprehensively screening an alignment for recombination breakpoints and inferring a unique phylogenetic history for each detected recombination block.  If GARD detects recombination in your dataset, it will provide you with an updated  partitioned  dataset, where each partition corresponds to a recombination block with its own corresponding phylogeny. This partitioned dataset can then be used as input (instead of your original data) for the selection inference method of interest.

For each site, MEME infers two  \\omega  rate classes and corresponding weights representing the probability that the site evolves under  \\omega  rate class, at a given branch. Importantly, to infer  \\omega  rates, MEME infers a single  \\alpha  (dS) value and two separate  \\beta  (dN) values,  \\beta^-  and  \\beta^+ , which share the same  \\alpha , per site. For both the null and alternative model, MEME enforces the constraint  \\beta^- \\leq \\alpha . The  \\beta^+  parameter is therefore the key difference between null and alternative models: In the null model,  \\beta^+  is constrained as in the null model:  \\beta^+ \\leq \\alpha , but  \\beta^+  is not constrained in the alternative model. Ultimately, positive selection for each site is inferred when  \\beta^+ > \\alpha  and shown to be significant using the likelihood ratio test.

            "text": "RELAX is a hypothesis testing framework that asks whether the strength of natural selection has been relaxed or intensified along a specified set of test branches. RELAX is therefore  not  a suitable method for explicitly testing for positive selection. Instead, RELAX is most useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection on a given gene.  RELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each). RELAX begins by fitting a codon model with three  \\omega   classes to the entire phylogeny (null model). RELAX then tests for relaxed/intensified selection by introducing the parameter  k  (where  k \\geq 0 ), serving as the  selection intensity parameter , as an exponent for the inferred  \\omega   values:  \\omega^k . Specifically, RELAX fixes the inferred  \\omega  values (all  \\omega_{<1,2,3>} ) and infers, for the test branches, a value for  k  which modifies the rates to  \\omega_{<1,2,3>}^k  (alternative model). RELAX then conducts a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the alternative and null models.   A significant result of  k 1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified  along the test branches, and a significant result of  k 1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed  along the test branches.  In addition to this pair of null/alternative models, RELAX fits three other models meant as complementary descriptors for the data, but are not suitable for hypothesis testing. These additional models include the following:   Partitioned MG94xREV  - This model fits a single  \\omega  value, i.e. shared for all sites, to each branch partition (reference and test). Here, a total of two  \\omega  rates are inferred.  Partitioned Descriptive  - This model, like a more standard branch-site model, fits three  \\omega   classes separately to each branch partition (reference and test, producing a total of six estimated  \\omega  rates estimated). The selection intensity parameter  k  is not included.  General Descriptive  - This model fits three  \\omega   classes to the full data set, ignoring the specified test and reference partition division (three total  \\omega  rates estimated). It subsequently fits a  k  parameter at each branch, ultimately tailoring the three  \\omega   class values to this branch. This model may serve as a useful description of how selection intensity fluctuates over the whole tree.

Like FEL, this method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.   SLAC begins by optimizing branch lengths and nucleotide substitution parameters under the MG94xREV model. However, rather than using ML to fit site-specific dN and dS parameters, SLAC instead uses ML to infer the most likely ancestral sequence at each node of the phylogeny. SLAC then employs a modified version of the  Suzuki-Gojobori counting method  to directly count the total number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes which have occurred at each site. Significance is ascertained at each site using an extended binomial distribution. Importantly, due to its counting-based approach, SLAC may not be accurate for data sets with high divergence levels.

Specifically, this tutorial explains how to use the \ncurrent release\n of HyPhy from the \ncommand line\n. \n\n\nAll analyses described here produce a final output JSON-formatted file which can be uploaded to \nHyPhy Vision\n for exploration. You can obtain a description of JSON contents for all analyses \nhere\n. In addition, each analyses will provide live \nMarkdown-formatted\n status indicators to the console while running. \n\n\nBefore you begin\n#\n\n\n\n\nInstall the current release of HyPhy on your computer, as needed, using \nthese instructions\n.\n\n\nThis tutorial employs example datasets, available for download as a \nzip file\n. Unpack this zip file on your machine for use and \nremember the absolute path to this directory\n. All datasets and output JSON files for this tutorial are in this zip file.\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes you are specifically using the HyPhy executable \nHYPHYMP\n. If you have installed a different executable (e.g. \nHYPHYMPI\n), you may need to alter some commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing labeled phylogenies\n#\n\n\nSeveral analyses are accept labeled phylogenies to define branch sets for selection testing. Moreover, the method \nRELAX\n \nrequires\n a labeled phylogeny to compare selection pressures. To assist in tree labeling, we recommend using our \nPhylotree Widget\n. Instructions for using this widget are available \nhere\n.\n\n\nPreparing input data for HyPhy\n#\n\n\nAll analyses require an alignment and corresponding phylogeny for analysis. There are options for preparing your data:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your data in two separate files with the alignment and phylogeny each. Most standard alignemnt formats are accepted (FASTA, phylip, etc.), and the phylogeny should be newick-formatted.\n\n\nPrepare your data in a single file containing a FASTA-formatted alignment, beneath which should be a newick-formatted phylogeny.\n\n\nPrepare your data as a NEXUS file with both a data matrix and tree block. Note that this file type will be necessary for performing a partitioned analysis, where different sites evolve according to different phylogenies (i.e. a recombination-corrected dataset from \nGARD\n.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these choices will trigger a slightly different data-input prompt, as described in the \nGeneral Information\n section below.\n\n\nGeneral Information\n#\n\n\nAll available selection analyses in HyPhy can be accessed by launching HyPhy from the command line by typing \nHYPHYMP\n (or launching \nHYPHYMPI\n in an appropriate MPI environment) and entering \n1\n to reach the \nSelection Analyses\n menu: \n\n\n\nIn this menu, launch your desired analyis by issuing its associated number (i.e. launch FEL by entering \n2\n upon reaching this menu).\n\n\nWithin each analysis, you will see a series of prompts for providing information. All analyses begin with the following prompts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Genetic Code\n. Generally, the universal genetic code (\n1\n) should be provided here, unless the dataset of interest uses a different NCBI-defined genetic code. For each option, the corresponding NCBI translation table is indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a coding sequence alignment file\n. This option prompts for the dataset to analyze. Provide the \nfull path\n to the dataset of interest. \n\n\n\n\nIf you provide a file containing only an alignment, HyPhy will issue a subsequent prompt: \nPlease select a tree file for the data\n. Supply the full path to your newick-formatted phylogeny here.\n\n\nIf you provide a file containing both an alignment and tree, HyPhy will prompt you to confirm that the tree provided should be used: \nA tree was found in the data file:...Would you like to use it (y/n)?\n. Enter \ny\n to use this tree, or enter \nn\n if a different tree is desired. HyPhy will then prompt for this path.\n\n\nIf you provide a NEXUS file, Hyphy will accept the tree(s) as given and will not issue a subsequent prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse BUSTED to test for alignment-wide episodic diversifying selection.\n#\n\n\n\n\nSee \nhere\n for a description of the BUSTED method.\n\n\n\n\nWe will demonstate BUSTED use with an alignment of primate sequences for the KSR2 gene, a kinase suppressor of RAS-2, from \nEnard et al, 2016\n.
